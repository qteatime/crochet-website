==================
The Crochet System
==================

.. warning::

   Crochet is still in development, and its current form is very
   experimental. Likewise, this book mostly reflects the current
   form of Crochet, and might change frequently, without much
   previous notice or support.

   You should not be writing anything serious in Crochet yet.

Crochet is a tool designed for creating and remixing
interactive media safely. In this book we'll see what
this system is, how it's structured, and how exactly
it allows "creating interactive media safely".
