How is Crochet structured?
==========================

Crochet programs are an amalgamation of all sorts of information. So how does
all of this data come together? How do we make sense of it? How does Crochet
use it? Those are all questions that understanding how information is
structured can help answer.

Structure isn't just a tool for humans, though. Computers also need information
to be structured in order to more easily be able to perform whatever work
we request from them. So in this section we'll dive deep into how Crochet
programs are structured, and what exactly these structures mean. After all,
there must be a reason why things are done the way they are, right?
