Logical models
==============

Crochet needs to represent answers to "yes/no" questions because
many of the features in the system require it. For example, we
may ask "does this value have the text type?", or we may ask
"is this number greater than that number?".

For this Crochet uses the simple form of boolean algebra, which
provides the values ``true`` and ``false`` (both of type ``boolean``).
