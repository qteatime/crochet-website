Effects
=======

By default Crochet programs can't do anything that users of it
can observe---which mostly means they can't do anything useful.
Effects close this gap in a way that maintains Crochet's
guarantees for safety and security. And in this section we
explore what exactly that means. We dive deep into what
effects are, how they're used, and how they achieve safety.
