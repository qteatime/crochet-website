Verification
============

We can manually test programs to see if they behave as expected,
but there's only so much we can really cover this way. Automated
verification complements this process by letting us tell Crochet
what we expect to happen and having Crochet verify that for us.

Automated verification in Crochet is divided between the
examples, contracts, and models.
