===========================
The Brief Syntax Cheatsheet
===========================

In this short book you'll find a quick reference of all syntactical
forms in Crochet, along with some usage examples. This book, however,
is not a *conceptual* reference---the assumption is that you're already
familiar with all of the concepts Crochet uses, and is here just for
a quick refresher on how a particular piece of syntax works.
