``new`` expression
==================

The new expression constructs an object from a certain type.
When the type has no parameters, it has the following syntax::

    new type-name

When a type has parameters, it has the following syntax::

    new type-name(
      Argument-1,
      Argument-2,
    )

Trailing commas are allowed in the list of arguments, but not required.
