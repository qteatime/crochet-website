Floating point literals
=======================

Floating point literals have the syntax::

    12345.6789

If a floating point has no significant fractional part, it must still
provide a ``0`` after the dot::

    12345.0

Underscores are allowed for grouping numbers without affecting the
semantics::

    123_456.789
