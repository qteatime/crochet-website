  - title: An Experimental Crochet
    release: 2021
    goal: >
      The first experimental release of Crochet aims to
      put its design to test, with some usable tooling.

      Though this release doesn't aim to provide good support
      for any specific domain, there will be varying degrees of
      support for interactive fiction, software testing, and
      language tooling.
    steps:
      - A fully-functioning Crochet VM
      - A REPL
      - Testing support
      - A reasonable collection of basic packages
      - A tool for managing Crochet projects
      - Basic editor support (VSCode)
      - Usable documentation

  - title: A Stable Crochet
    release: 2024
    goal: >
      With the core design of Crochet validated, the next step
      is putting together a stable implementation of the language
      that can be used for production use cases.

      No security proofs will happen here, but they should happen
      later.
    steps:
      - An AOT Crochet compiler with JS and WASM as backends
      - An optimised Crochet runtime
      - Stabilising the collection of basic packages
      - Basic package management
